# Usage

1. Clone with submodules

  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/coin8086/vim-settings.git
  ```

2. Install

```bash
cd vim-settings && ./install
```

You may need to add option `-f` for `install` to remove old `~/.vim` and `~/.vimrc` files for you.

```bash
./install -f
```
